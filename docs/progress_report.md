**Progress Update (May 28, 2025):**

- **Google AI Models Integration**: Added comprehensive support for Google's Gemini API models alongside existing OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere options.
- **Shared Access Implementation**: Set up shared Google AI access as default with automatic fallback to user API keys when needed - no initial setup required.
- **Current Model Support**: Updated to latest model versions including Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Command R+ based on official provider documentation.
- **Enhanced API Key Handling**: Sophisticated API key management allowing users to optionally provide keys for any provider, with shared Google access as baseline.
- **Resilient Architecture**: Multi-tier fallback system (shared Google → user Google → BYOK providers) for maximum reliability and user choice.
- **Smart Configuration UI**: Context-aware interface showing different states (shared access, user key, required) with helpful links to official API key sources.
- **Landing Page Enhancement**: Updated messaging to reflect shared access model without mentioning specific rate limits to accommodate multi-user shared usage.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Comprehensive updates to product spec, technical design, and implementation plan reflecting the new shared-first, user-enhanced architecture.
- **Production Ready**: Designed for multi-user deployment with shared backend API keys while supporting user enhancement for unlimited personal access.
- Ready for backend implementation of multi-tier API access and enhanced authentication flows.

**Progress Update (May 28, 2025 - Evening):**

- **Lint Issues Resolution**: Fixed ESLint error regarding unescaped apostrophes by properly escaping with HTML entities (&apos;) in text content.
