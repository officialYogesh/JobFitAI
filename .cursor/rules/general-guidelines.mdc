  High‑level guardrails for Cursor’s AI agent: certainty threshold,
  command‑execution policy, package‑manager preference, naming
  conventions, and progress‑tracking workflow.
alwaysApply: true
---

## 1 · CERTAINTY THRESHOLD
Cursor must **only perform automated code changes when ≥ 95 % confident**
the modification is correct and safe. If confidence is below that
threshold, the agent must ask clarifying questions first.

## 2 · COMMAND‑EXECUTION POLICY
Cursor **MUST NOT** execute shell commands.

1. Output the exact **PowerShell** command required.  
2. Wait for the user to run it and paste back stdout/stderr.  
3. Continue based on the returned output.

This applies to all build, lint, test, migration, and git commands.

## 3 · PACKAGE MANAGER
Use **pnpm** (v8+) exclusively.

* All CLI examples start with `pnpm …` (e.g., `pnpm install`).  
* Lock‑file must be **`pnpm-lock.yaml`**.  
* CI scripts and docs must reflect pnpm usage.

## 4 · NAMING & STYLE CONVENTIONS
* Boolean variables start with verbs: `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canSubmit`.  
* Use complete words over abbreviations (except standard ones: API, URL, err, ctx, req, res).  
* Avoid magic numbers — define **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** constants.  
* File & directory names: **kebab‑case**.  
* One export per file; keep functions short and single‑purpose.

## 5 · SESSION PROGRESS REPORT
At the **end of each working session**, Cursor must create or update
`progress_report.md` with:

* **What was accomplished** in the session.  
* **Next planned tasks / open questions**.

This ensures a persistent breadcrumb trail for resuming work later.

## 6 · REVIEW CHECKLIST
☑ ≥ 95 % confidence confirmed.  
☑ Commands provided, not executed.  
☑ pnpm used exclusively.  
☑ Naming conventions followed; no magic numbers.  
☑ `progress_report.md` updated with accomplishments & next steps.
